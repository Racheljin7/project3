  Richard Renaldi is an American Photographer. He received a BFA in photography from New York University in 1990. He is represented by Benrubi Gallery in New York and Robert Morat Galerie in Berlin. Four monographs of his work have been published, including Richard Renaldi: Figure and Ground (Aperture, 2006); Fall River Boys (Charles Lane Press, 2009); Touching Strangers (Aperture, 2014); and Manhattan Sunday (Aperture, 2016). He was the recipient of a 2015 fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Here he discusses what itâ€™s like to go back and examine your own archives, the importance of creating an online showcase for your creative work, and why sometimes you just need to put your camera down and experience whatever happens to be in front of you.
